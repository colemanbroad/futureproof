This project is **done**, and I don't plan to maintain it in the future.

It is only claimed to work on my laptop,
and even then,
will probably break if the Zig compiler version changes.

I'm unlikely to fix any issues,
although I will optimistically merge small-to-medium PRs that fix bugs
or add support for more platforms.

If you'd like to add major features, please fork the project;
I'd be happy to link to any forks which achieve critical momemtum!
